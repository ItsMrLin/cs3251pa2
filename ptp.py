This is the Perry Transport Protocol

Our Reliable Transport Protocol (RTP) is an improved version of 
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), but with better performance, 
more secure data transmitting, a more concise header, and improved 
connection management.

		When end-point A does not have any data to send A sends a FIN 
		(resending it if it does not get an ACK after a normal packet 
		timeout). B sends an ACK. A receives this ACK and releases 
		resources for itâ€™s sending queue and not-acked queue. A is not 
		done sending data, but B may still be sending data to A.

		When B is done sending data to A, it sends a FIN and closes. If 
		A receives the FIN it closes immediately, otherwise it closes 
		after 60 seconds.
